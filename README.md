## Overview

This a userscript that adds a variety of features to snapcraft.io. Currently the feature list includes:
 * Automatically link snaps on the "My Stores" page to their corresponding location in the dashboard
 * Add download links for both snaps and their `snap-revision` assertion for each revision on a snap's dashboard
 * Add a download link for the `snap-declaration` assertion on a snap's dashboard

## Installation
### Prerequisites

Use of userscripts requires the installation of an add-on to manage and execute installed userscripts. I personally use and test against [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

### Installing

Once you have an add-on like Tampermonkey installed, you can install the userscript with the link below:
